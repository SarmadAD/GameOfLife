Welcome to my small GameOfLife Project. 

## Features
- implemented the basic rules 
- cells can be entered
- start and stop
- overview of generations

## Rules
- Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
- Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.
- Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
